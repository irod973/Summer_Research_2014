This repository contains all code used during my summer research under Pat Burchat in 2014, in collaboration with Luis Alvarez, Mandeep Gill, and Josh Meyers. Our research focused on the blending challenge for future astronomical surveys, particularly for the upcoming LSST. I studied the shape bias resulting from undetected blends.

The code in this repo simulates undetected galaxy blends through a mixture model. The following directories contain all code produced for these studies. Each directory in this repo contains its own Readme with additional information on its contents. All files are fairly commented as well. 

If there are any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me at irodriguez@stanford.edu.

Python_Work - Contains simulations of mixtures using pure python. Many files here were used for learning purposes, thus most of the meaningful results lie in the Galsim_Work directory.
Galsim_Work - Contains simulations of mixtures using the Galsim package for python. Includes galaxies modeled as Gaussian and Sersic distributions.
